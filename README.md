you have mild smile but why you gave me smell ?
you make me laugh but why you take my love ?
you are crunchy but why you are crispy ?
you almost be friend but why you always be my friend ?
loud laugh lift my level of love in my lovely life
leave a leaf as looping lyrics and leap to my lap
likely look alike a luck lake that is lock my like
a lot of light lit a lathe's lout and let me late
hatred hurt my hoodoo heart and hard to hear your heed
holy hood hide my hard and hold your high head
i have hope for heavy happy in this hive will happen
hale and hearty heal my half heart as in heaven
happily never after. we always together
cause i have friend. hope for over happy forever
hope for over happy forever
